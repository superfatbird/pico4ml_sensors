The video data will be transfered over 1-bit interface in this 
dev board according to the connection. Only D0 is connected. 

The HM01B0 has 324 by 324 pixels. QVGA is 320x240.
By setting register 0x3010[0] to 1 will active the QVGA window
readout. Ref the data sheet for the window pixel range. First 
pixel to readout is X=0, y=40; I guess the last pixel to readout
in such case will be x=324, y=284.

The image sensor has five modes, determined by the Mode_select
register bits 2:0. Mode streaming 1 and mode streaming 2 will be
the mode of interest of in this case. 

clock, MCLK (need more info)

0x3059[6:5] register bits determine the interface bit width.
0x3060[4] determine MSB/LSB.
0x3065[1:0] determine the output pin and INT pin status in 
		standby mode and streaming mode.
0x3059,0x3060 register determine the data format, gated vs
		not gated, LSB vs MSB. Page32, section 6.6.

2 wire serial interface is used to access teh sensor register.
Host controller should generate SCL clock to sync SDA.
I2C address of the sensor is 0x24.
